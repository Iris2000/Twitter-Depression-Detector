## Description

This project was carried out to introduce an NLP-based architecture for accurately predicting depressive risks using social media posts and identifying depressive symptoms associated with the posts. It utilized various techniques to enable prediction models to distinguish between depressive and non-depressive posts. A new technique was proposed to demonstrate the possibility of using a custom LIWC dictionary to detect depressive symptoms from text. The analysis results were visualized on a web-based dashboard application. This application can assist mental health professionals in identifying behavioral signs of depression and alerting them to patients who may be at risk. Additionally, patients can utilize the system to assess their mental health status and contact their doctors as needed. Since anyone can use it to check their own mental health, the system has the potential to enhance public awareness about mental health issues.

The underlying motivation behind this project was to address the growing concern of mental health during challenging times such as the Covid-19 pandemic. I noticed a significant increase in negative posts on social media platforms, which indicated a potential rise in mental health issues among individuals. I wanted to contribute to raising awareness about mental health issues and provide a platform that could offer support and guidance to those in need. By harnessing the potential of NLP and developing a user-friendly web-based application, I aspired to make a positive impact on the lives of individuals struggling with mental health challenges, while also promoting overall mental well-being in society.
